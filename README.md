🙋‍♂️ Hello!
On the Freelancer Site, I can't tell you that I want to use Teams or Telegram.
To be honest, the chat is not convenient in Freelancer Site.

So, can we connect via Microsoft Teams or Telegram?
You can also reach me directly at: 📧 openminddev0715@gmail.com
I want you to send me the Telegram and Email Address by Email.
*** You shouldn't mention the Email or Telegram on the Freelancer Site.
I can't answer that.
